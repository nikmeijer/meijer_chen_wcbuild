            <p class="lb_text">
                Jérôme Agyenim Boateng (born 3 September 1988) is a German professional footballer who plays as a centre-back for French Ligue 1 club Lyon.
            <p class="lb_text">
                A versatile defender, Boateng primarily is a centre-back, although he can also play as a right-back. Physically strong and composed in possession, he has gained a reputation as a tough-tackling defender, with good passing and an ability to read the game. Despite his talent in his youth, he was initially accused by certain pundits of being error-prone defensively; however, he later came to be considered one of the world's best players in his position.
